# Introduction

## What?

Using FTP/SSH/SCP/SFTP.

## Why?

FTP/SSH/SCP/SFTP might be permitted outbound, or at least most likely will be from some locations as theyâ€™re often 
used as data exchange protocols. Client tools are also readily available on systems without the need to pull down 
additional binaries.
