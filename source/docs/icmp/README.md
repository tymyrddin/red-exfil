# Introduction

## What?

Data exfiltration can also leverage ICMP flows with a C2 server, using the data payload in ICMP-PING packets.

## Why?

The detection of data exfiltration using this method is not easy since itâ€™s hard to tell apart "normal", legit 
ICMP traffic from ICMP flows part of an exfiltration attempt. Furthermore, some tools used for endpoint telemetry, 
such as Sysmon, record TCP/UDP connections but not ICMP flows.
