# Introduction

## What?

Practice data exfiltration techniques (in the THM Lab environment set up for it) to emulate normal network activities, such as DNS, HTTP, SSH, etc. 

## Why?

Data exfiltration over common protocols is challenging to detect and distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic.

## How?

* [Exfiltration using TCP socket](tcp.md)
* [Exfiltration using FTP/SSH/SCP/SFTP](ssh.md)
* [Data exfiltration over HTTP](https.md)
* [HTTP tunneling](https-tunnel.md)
* [Data exfiltration over ICMP](icmp.md)
* [ICMP C2 communication](icmp-c2.md)
* [Exfiltration over DNS](dns.md)
* [DNS tunneling](dns-tunnel.md)
